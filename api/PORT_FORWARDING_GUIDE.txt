PORT FORWARDING GUIDE FOR WE-CONNECT CRM
========================================

To access this application from another system, follow these steps:

1. ON THIS SYSTEM (192.168.1.14):
   - The application is running on: http://localhost:3010
   - Make sure the application is running (npm run start:dev)

2. ON ANOTHER SYSTEM (same network):
   - Open a web browser
   - Go to: http://192.168.1.14:3010
   - You should see the application

3. FOR ACCESS FROM OUTSIDE YOUR NETWORK:
   a) Find your public IP address (search "what is my ip" on Google)
   b) Set up port forwarding on your router:
      - Login to your router (usually http://192.168.1.1)
      - Find the "Port Forwarding" section
      - Add a new rule:
        * Service Name: WeConnect CRM
        * External Port: 3010
        * Internal IP: 192.168.1.14
        * Internal Port: 3010
        * Protocol: TCP
      - Save the rule
   c) On the remote system, access: http://<your-public-ip>:3010

4. FIREWALL SETTINGS (if needed):
   - Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security
   - Go to Inbound Rules
   - Add a new rule for port 3010 TCP
   - Allow the connection

5. TESTING:
   - From another computer on the same network, try: http://192.168.1.14:3010
   - From outside your network, try: http://<your-public-ip>:3010

NOTE: For production use, consider:
- Using HTTPS instead of HTTP
- Setting up proper authentication
- Using a domain name instead of IP address
- Configuring a reverse proxy like Nginx
